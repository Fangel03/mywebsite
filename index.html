        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">AT&T Sales Associate | Polar Marketing</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">May 2025 – June 2025</p>
        <p>I went into neighborhoods following warm leads to talk to people about the services AT&T offered; mobile plans, internet, and TV.
	My job was to explain how these services could benefit them, answer any questions they had, and help them sign up for what worked best for their needs. 
	I built rapport and made sure I understood what customers were looking for, so I could offer them the best solutions.
	I met a lot of new people, and there was a real sense of accomplishment when I helped someone find exactly what they needed.</p>

	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Retail Associate | House Of Cards</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">June 2024 – February 2025</p>
	<p>I assisted customers with product selection by providing knowledgeable and friendly service to ensure a positive shopping experience. 
	I handled transactions efficiently, promoted ongoing sales and loyalty programs, and helped maintain a clean and organized store environment. 
	In addition to restocking merchandise and supporting daily operations, I worked closely with team members to achieve sales goals while delivering high customer service standards.

	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Microsoft Concierge Ambassador | Education At Work</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">May 2022 – August 2022</p>
        <p>I was part of a team dedicated to supporting small to medium-sized businesses with a wide range of technical inquiries. 
	A significant portion of our work involved configuring mail flow rules to help administrators mitigate and respond to malicious emails. 
	We also assisted customers with setting up and navigating their Azure portals.
	Our team prioritized efficiency and responsiveness, addressing assigned support tickets promptly—even when the information provided was minimal. 
	We conducted thorough research as needed and followed up with customers to gather additional details or provide further guidance. When necessary, 
	we utilized Microsoft Quick Assist to remotely view customer screens, allowing us to deliver more effective, hands-on support.</p>
